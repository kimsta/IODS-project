# Week 1 experiences

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*


I have downloaded and installed R and R studio for my computer. I also did instal GitHub desktop application. R tools are useful for working with large datasets and GitHub is usegul for editing code or project online simultaniously with other authors.  


Working with R is feeling natural, allthough I have some experience using R in advance.  


I have some problems concerning my course diary page. I can't get my updates to show up there. Hopeflly I can figure this out soon enough.  

I did manage to solve this problem with help from section 9 in course page. Very nice. I just dont yet know if I have to do this fix allways or just once.  

A new problem. Now I have accidently two "pages" appearing to my course diary page. I just can't figure this one out. Attleast I have my main problem solved. lol.

This course seems to be just what i was looking for.
